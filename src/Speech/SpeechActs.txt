Do as I say, or I'll punish you.
I’m still mad at you.
Stop doing that.
You aren’t being fair.
I don't trust you.
Excellent.
Sweet! We are getting rich.
Give me another chance.
I forgive you.
I'm changing my strategy.
I hope to find a compromise that is good for both of us.
Curse you.
You betrayed me.
You will pay for this.
In your face.
Let’s cooperate.
I should get higher payoffs.
You should get higher payoffs.
Let's play <>.
Thanks.
